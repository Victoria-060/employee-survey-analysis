## Analysis & Insights

### Q1: Survey Questions with Most Agreement or Disagreement

In no particular order, questions 4, 1, 5, 2 and 9 show the strongest levels of "Agree" and "Strongly Agree" responses. While question 6 relating to having a bestfriend at work show slightly higher levels of disagreement or "Not Applicable" hinting that there is minimal relationship/friendship between employees. Also worthy of noting that a number of employee also gave "Disagree" response in regards to receiving recognition for doing a good job in the last seven days (Question 3). Although it is not to be compared with "Agree" and "Strongly agree" responses to that question, it was still a lot higher than the "Disagree" response to other questions.
